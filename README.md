# 🔐 AI-Based Authentication Threat Detection System (MVP)

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a behavior-based cybersecurity threat detection system focused on authentication activity monitoring. 

The system uses an unsupervised machine learning model (Isolation Forest) to detect anomalous login patterns and classify them into risk levels.

This is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) demonstrating how AI can enhance authentication-layer security monitoring.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional cybersecurity systems are often reactive and detect breaches only after damage occurs. 

Authentication systems are common entry points for attackers through:
- Brute-force login attempts
- Credential stuffing
- Suspicious login timing
- Foreign IP access

This project provides an AI-based approach to detect suspicious login behavior early.

## 🧠 Solution Approach

The system follows a modular architecture:

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Reads authentication logs from a CSV file.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Uses numerical features such as:
     - Login hour
     - Failed attempts
     - Foreign IP indicator

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Applies Isolation Forest (unsupervised learning)
   - Detects abnormal login behavior

4. **Threat Scoring**
   - Converts anomaly output into:
     - LOW RISK
     - MEDIUM RISK
     - HIGH RISK

5. **Visualization**
   - Displays results through a Flask-based dashboard

## 📊 Example Detection Scenario

| hour | failed_attempts | foreign_ip | anomaly | risk |
|------|----------------|------------|---------|------|
| 2    | 6              | 1          | -1      | HIGH RISK |

The system flags this as a high-risk authentication attempt.
